Will control the dialouge in the scene, due to limited dialouge in game it doesnt need to be entierly modular and we should be able to scrape by with a simple implementation
*/

public class DialougeManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
